## Abstract


## Introduction


N-of-1 trials are cross-over trials where the randomization is conducted at the subject rather than the group level. This modification has a number of important implications, among them:

1. Data from individual subjects can be analyzed on their own
2. When putting together data from multiple N-of-1 trials, the synthesis is made following meta-analysis principles
3. Similar to cross-over trials, the design will have to carefully consider issues such as carry-over effect, period effects, intra-subject correlation
4. Since N-of-1 trials are randomized controlled trials, most of the principles applicable to parallel trials also apply to N-of-1, and so the [CONSORT statement](http://www.consort-statement.org/) has to be observed, obviously with modifications.

Although this design has a number of potential application within research focused on Personalized Lifelong Learning, educational trials making of an N-of-1 design are few and scattered. The objective of this review is therefore to cover the basic principles behind N-of-1 trial design applied to online educational trials, covering practical implementation suggestions and also outlining a first iteration of a structure for their semantic representation.

## Design and randomization issues

<!-- need to add specifics about education -->

N-of-1 trials are part of a wide range of trial design types that can be applied in an online environment. Currently, one of the most comprehensive sources of information on different types of trial designs and their combination is defined through [Facebook]()'s [Planout framework]().

<!-- outline basic structure for planout from their web site - check 3d proposal for links -->

N-of-1 trials have inherited some issues that are typical from crossover trials, namely carryover effects, the need for run-in and washout periods, and period effects. These are described in the following sections.

### Carryover effect

<!-- need to get crossover book and check each of the three effects -->

[Carryover effect and counterbalancing](http://psych.csufresno.edu/price/psych144/counterbalancing.html) - this document has an excellent coverage of the issue of counterbalancing in N-of-1 trials, or to "test different subjects under the different conditions in different orders." Counterbalancing is essential in education since most educational interventions will have a carryover effect. The reason why counterbalancing can help is explained in the article above:

>    Why does counterbalancing help?  In many cases, the carryover effect in one direction will simply cancel out the carryover effect in the other direction.  Imagine that there is a practice effect in our noise experiment, so that subjects tend to be better at the concentration task under the second condition.  If we counterbalance, then for some subjects the practice effect will boost their performance a bit in the noisy condition, and for others it will boost their performance a bit in the quiet condition.  As a result, these two effects will cancel each other out when we aggregate the data across all the subjects.


### Run-in and washout

[Run-in period](http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=67147) is a period before the trial starts when subjects are kept without an intervention that could potentially interfere with the efficacy evaluation ([@pablos1998run](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187167)). A washout period is identical to the run-in, but applied in between interventions in an N-of-1 trial. In an educational context, this will usually mean that the educational intervention should be stopped between the intervention periods. 

### Period effects  

When the rate of a certain outcome varies over time independently from the intervention. In an educational context, this would be applicable to extended trials involving children, where their cognitive ability will improve over time independently from the educational intervention. The same would be applicable to, for example, an instructional program on how to use a medical record where students are actually exposed to the medical record for their daily activities. The latter means that their ability to use the medical record would increase independently from the educational intervention. Sometimes that exposure can occur at different rates since different groups might make more or less use of certain medical record features, therefore adding to the complexity of period effects.




## Data visualization and modeling

When it comes to visualization and modeling, N-of-1 trials also borrow from crossover trials. Specifically, packages such as [crossdes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crossdes/) for the [R language]() are helpful. <!-- insert r citation --> Crossdes main functions include:

* get.plan: Menu-driven selection of crossover designs
* allcombs: Construct crossover design with all possible treatment orders
* williams: Construct a Williams design
* williams.BIB: Construct a crossover design based on a combination of balanced incomplete block
* designs and Williams designs.
* des.MOLS: Construct crossover design based on mutually orthogonal Latin Squares
* balmin.RMD: Construct balanced minimal repeated measurements crossover design
* isCbalanced: Check whether a crossover design is balanced for Ô¨Årst order carryover effects
* isGYD: Check whether a crossover design is balanced

## Reporting guidelines for where N-of-1 can be used

The primary reporting guidelines for N-of-1 is the CONSORT extension for n-of-1 [(CENT)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/S1/P410/). Since CENT has not yet been published, below is an incomplete list with some of the internal standards for oru research group:


|Main section|Subsections|
|---|---|
|Trial design|Planned number and duration of each period, run-in and wash out with rationale, series of N- of-1 trials|
|Ethics|IRB approval, including details on informed consent or why it was waived|
|Participants|Eligibility and settings, recruitment methods|
|Interventions|Reproducible description with content being made available as an open repository|
|Outcomes|Primary and secondary, including factors such as information absorption, ability to solve problems, User eXperience (UX) and ability to put information to real-world practice|
|Sample size|Reproducible through scripts and links to preliminary data or relevant publications|
|Stopping rules|Set upfront or decided during the trial|
|Randomization|Sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding|
|Data analysis|Fully reproducible with corresponding scripts, assumption checking (carry-over effect, period effects, intra-subject correlation), efficacy evaluation, synthesis methods if more than one N-of-1 is being used (how heterogeneity between participants was assessed, [PRISMA guidelines](http://www.prisma-statement.org/))
|Reproducicle research|Scripts available on sites such as [Github](https://github.com/), data available on sites such as Github and [Figshare](http://figshare.com/), storage of software packages]
|N-of-1 data compilation| [Use-case driven](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221465095_A_Proposal_for_a_Unified_Process_for_Ontology_Building_UPON/file/79e4150a24778016df.pdf) [ontology](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) modeling which extends [Cook and Pietrobon, 2007](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17847604), connection with R packages|


## A proposed semantic representation

### Use case 

The use case for this N-of-1 educational trial ontology is as follows:

1. A group of educational trials using an N-of-1 design are published through either a systematic review or by originally compiling the articles from an original search.
2. Its design and results are encoded using the N-of-1 trial ontology 
3. Based on the encoded data a qualitative table is automatically created comparing the characteristics of each individual N-of-1 trial, so that inclusion and exclusion can be generated.
4. Based on the previously described inclusion and exclusion criteria The encoded data are imported into a statistical language like [R]() and then functions such as [crossdes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crossdes/), and a meta-analysis of the quantitative data is automatically generated.



### Semantic structure

## Conclusion

N-of-1 trials hold a lot of promise for educational trials, and so it is our hope that review articles such as this might provide an incentive for its broader use in the data-driven education community. Specifically, it is our hope that by using a semantic approach to N-of-1 trial data the aggregation of individual subject data towards large meta-analyses, educational practice guidelines, ultimately improving our global educational standards in online lifelong personalized learning.
